  <h3>Forge4Flow provides a Backend as a Service (BaaS) for the Flow Blockchain, offering a suite of tools for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) seamlessly.</h3>

</div>

## The problem it solves

Developers face challenges in creating dApps due to issues like user authentication, access control, system monitoring, and third-party integration. Forge4Flow aims to address these problems with a comprehensive Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform. We're excited to introduce several tool sets to empower developers and enhance the ecosystem:

### Auth4Flow (Beta Released):

> Simplify Web3 access with our open-source Identity and Access Management platform. Auth4Flow supports RBAC, FGAC, ReBAC, and NFT/FT gated access for seamless user verification in DApps and Web2.

### Functions4Flow (Beta Released):

> Power your Flow blockchain projects with Functions4Flow's serverless platform. Easily deploy NodeJS and Go functions for dynamic dApp functionalities.

### Database4Flow (In Development):

> Fuel your decentralized projects with Database4Flow, providing a robust database for seamless data management.

### Storage4Flow (In Development):

> Elevate data handling in Forge4Flow with Storage4Flow, offering secure and scalable storage functionalities for your decentralized applications.

### Realtime4Flow (In Development):

> Transform your dApps with Realtime4Flow, empowering dynamic interactions and data synchronization for an immersive user experience.

### FlowComponents (In Development):

> Simplify mobile dApp development on Flow Blockchain with our open-source SwiftUI library. Offering reusable views and intuitive extensions for robust and user-friendly interfaces.

By providing these tool sets, we aim to empower developers to focus on delivering exceptional user experiences without worrying about complex authentication, access control, and other Web3 challenges.
