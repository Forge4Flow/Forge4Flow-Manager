## Instructions for testing a patch for faasd

### Launch a virtual machine

You can use any kind of Linux virtual machine, Ubuntu 20.04 is recommended.

Launch a cloud VM or use [Multipass](https://multipass.run), which is free to use an can be run locally. A Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 could also be used, but will need you to run `make dist` to cross compile a valid binary.

### Copy over your SSH key

Your SSH key will be used, so that you can copy a new faasd binary over to the host.

```bash
multipass launch \
  --memory 4G \
  -c 2 \
  -n faasd

# Then access its shell
multipass shell faasd

# Edit .ssh/authorized_keys

# Add .ssh/id_rsa.pub from your host and save the file
```

### Install faasd on the VM

You start off with the upstream version of faasd on the host, then add the new version over the top later on.

```bash
cd /tmp/
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1
cd faasd/hack
./install.sh

# Run the login command given to you at the end of the script
```

Get the multipass IP address:

```bash
export IP=$(multipass info faasd --format json| jq -r '.info.faasd.ipv4[0]')
```

### Build a new faasd binary with the patch

Check out faasd on your local computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd
cd faasd

gh pr checkout #PR_NUMBER_HERE

GOOS=linux go build

# You can also run "make dist" which is slower, but includes
# a version and binaries for other platforms such as the Raspberry Pi
```

### Copy it over to the VM

Now build a new faasd binary and copy it to the VM:

```bash
scp faasd ubuntu@$IP:~/
```

Now deploy the new version on the VM:

```bash
killall -9 faasd-linux; killall -9 faasd-linux ; mv ./faasd-linux /usr/local/bin/faasd
```

### Check it worked and test that patch

Now run a command with `faas-cli` such as:

* `faas-cli list`
* `faas-cli version`

See the testing instructions on the PR and run through those steps.
